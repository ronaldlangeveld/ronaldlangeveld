# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Product Engineer at Ghost ðŸ‘», building really cool open-source publishing software.

Born and raised in South Africa ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦, currently based on South Korea.

When not coding, I love capturing moments through the lens. I shoot digital and film.

Check out my little [blog](https://ronald.ink) that also runs on Ghost.

I speak English and Afrikaans natively and can get by in Dutch ðŸ§€ and Korean (ì•ˆë…•!ðŸ‘‹)!
