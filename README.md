# Hello 👋

I'm a Product Engineer at Ghost 👻, building really cool open-source publishing software.

Born and raised in South Africa 🇿🇦, I've lived and studied in Seoul 🇰🇷 since the age of 18 and now work remotely, usually from South East Asia.

When not coding, I love capturing moments through the lens. I shoot digital and film.

Check out my little [blog](https://ronald.ink) that also runs on Ghost.

I speak English and Afrikaans natively and can get by in Dutch 🧀 and Korean (안녕!👋)!
