# Hello ğŸ‘‹

I'm a Product Engineer at Ghost ğŸ‘», building really cool open-source publishing software.

Born and raised in South Africa ğŸ‡¿ğŸ‡¦, I've lived and studied in Seoul ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡· and now work remotely, usually from South East Asia.

When not coding, I love capturing moments through the lens. I shoot digital and film, wielding a Fujifilm XE4 and a Kodak Ultra-F9.

Check out my little ğŸ“¸ [photo blog](https://ronald.ink) that also runs on Ghost.

I speak English and Afrikaans natively and can get by in Dutch ğŸ§€ and Korean (ì•ˆë…•!ğŸ‘‹)!
