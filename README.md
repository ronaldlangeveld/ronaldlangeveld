# Hello üëã

I'm Ronald and this is my GitHub Repo.
You can find my little blog and a list of notable projects I've worked on, on my personal website, [https://ronaldlangeveld.com](https://www.ronaldlangeveld.com).

Most of my work are private repo's but I'm slowly finding my way into the open source world, so expect that to be growing in the coming months.

## My Tech Stack ‚öôÔ∏è
I tend to pride myself for being able to pick up new languages and technologies quite quickly, but I've confidently built projects from start to finish using tools such as Python, Django, Flask, NodeJS, Express, ReactJS, and NextJS.

Thesedays I mostly working with NodeJS and React.
