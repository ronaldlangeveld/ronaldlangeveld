# Hello ğŸ‘‹

I'm a Product Engineer at Ghost ğŸ‘», building really cool open-source publishing software.

Born and raised in South Africa ğŸ‡¿ğŸ‡¦, currently based on South Korea.

When not coding, I love capturing moments through the lens. I shoot digital and film.

Check out my little [blog](https://ronald.ink) that also runs on Ghost.
